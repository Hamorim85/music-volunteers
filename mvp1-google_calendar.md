#MVP 1: Google Calendar

###Assumptions
Our fundamental assumption is that health care activity directors and volunteer musicians want to connect to offer performances, and that both groups will work together to offer concerts, but need a common scheduling tool. Our first crack at this will be to create a simple Google Calendar and some conventions for use. We will also provide an email to a small set of health care activity directors and music students with an offer to share the calendar with them

###Hypotheses to be Tested
We want to use this to test the following (for all these, need to determine acceptable percentages):
- Acquisitiion: Health care activity directors see enough value from our email to sign up (respond to the email requesting we share the calendar). 
- Activation: Health care activity directors are able to create a performance request (Event in Google Calendar) that meets our conventions.
- Retention: Activity directors create at least 2 performance requests (do we need to put more restrictions on that? e.g., they create the second after the first performance is completed?)
- Referral: Activity directors request that we share the calendar with their friends and colleagues.
- Acquisitioin: Volunteer musicians see enough value from our email to sign up (respond to the email requesting we share the calendar)
- Activation: Volunteer musicians are able to find suitable performance requests and book them (Edit event in Google Calendar) that meets our conventions. 
- Retentioin: Volunteer musicians book at least 2 performances (do we need to put more restrictions on that? e.g., they create the second after the first performance is completed?)
- Referral: Volunteer musicians request that we share the calendar with their friends and colleagues
- Revenue is not a factor, as this is a free service offered by a non-profit.
